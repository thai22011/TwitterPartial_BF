# An Overview of The 5.4M Leaked Twitter Accounts

ALl Emails and Phone Numbers were removed for Privacy Reasons

## INTRODUCTION

A security vulnerability in Twitter's API was exploited to steal over 5.4 million user records containing private information, which were subsequently shared on a hacker forum, Breached. The data was originally sold for  $30,000 in July 2022 and is now available for free. Let's do a EDA to understand more about the leaked accounts. All emails and phone numbers were removed for privacy reasons.

This number is greater than 53 bits and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it. Using a signed 64 bit integer for storing this identifier is safe. Use id_str to fetch the identifier to be safe. See Twitter IDs for more information. Example: "id": 6253282                |\n|  1 | id_str                  | String                       | The string representation of the unique identifier for this User. Implementations should use this rather than the large, possibly un-consumable integer in id. Example: "id_str": "6253282"                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|  2 | name                    | String                       | The name of the user, as they’ve defined it. Not necessarily a person’s name. Typically capped at 50 characters, but subject to change. Example: "name": "Twitter API"                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|  3 | screen_name             | String                       | The screen name, handle, or alias that this user identifies themselves with. screen_names are unique but subject to change. Use id_str as a user identifier whenever possible. Typically a maximum of 15 characters long, but some historical accounts may exist with longer names. Example: "screen_name": "twitterapi"                                                                   |\n|  4 | location                | String                       | Nullable . The user-defined location for this account’s profile. Not necessarily a location, nor machine-parseable. This field will occasionally be fuzzily interpreted by the Search service.
